      <h2> The British Actress reveals whether she would ever return to acting after four-year break</h2>
      <p>“I wasn’t very happy if I’m being honest. I think I felt a bit caged,” she said in an interview with the
        Financial Times. “The thing I found really hard was that I had to go out and sell something that I really didn’t
        have very much control over. <br> She added: “It was very difficult to have to be the face and the spokesperson
        for things where I didn’t get to
        be involved in the process.” <br>
        That does not mean to say she will never step in front of a camera again. Watson said she would be open to the
        idea if the role was “right”. <br>
        She explained she did not want to “fracture herself into different faces and people”, adding: “I don’t want to
        switch into robot mode any more.”</p>
